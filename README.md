# AT-Content of DNA Sequence Measurement

Bioinformatics has been one of the most important major when it comes to personalized medicine, to design a drug for a particular patient it is necessary to know the amount of AT-content of DNA sequence. We have dataset of 10 patients where we want to know the amount of AT-content of their DNA sequence.

# Your Task
Your program will take path of ``patients.csv`` file and perform the following operations:

-Import csv file into dataframe structure

-Find the average AT-Content of DNA where patient age is above 10

-Find the average AT-Content of DNA where patient age is below 10

# Expected Results

AT-Content of patient above 10: 0.58

AT-Content of patients above 10:0.42

# Hints
 You can use:
 
 -loops
 
 -if/else conditions
 
 -mean()
